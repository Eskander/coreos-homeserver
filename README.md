# Home Server services

This repositoty houses a collection of services I run for my personal needs on my home server.

The services are defined according to the [Compose specification](https://compose-spec.io/) and run on [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/coreos) using rootless [Podman](https://podman.io/).
